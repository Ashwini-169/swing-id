# swing-id

This project demonstrates a hanging ID card using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Matter.js for physics simulation.

## Features

- A visually styled ID card with a photo, name, and role.
- Realistic hanging effect using a rope simulated with Matter.js.
- Interactive physics allowing the card to swing and react to mouse interactions.
- Slight wind effect for added realism.

## File Structure

- `id.html`: Contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the hanging ID card.

## How to Run

1. Open the `id.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. Interact with the card by dragging it with your mouse.

## Dependencies

- [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/): A 2D physics engine for the web.

## Preview

The ID card is styled with a circular photo, name, and role, and it hangs from a rope that reacts to physics and user interactions.
